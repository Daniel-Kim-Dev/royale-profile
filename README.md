To use this app, go to [Clash Royale API](https://developer.clashroyale.com)
and make a token with your ip address whitelisted. Then copy paste your token to
`const token` in the `/server/index.js` file.

Make sure to run the command `npm install` in the `client` folder to install the `node_modules`.

Then open two terminals with one in the `client` folder and the other in the `server` folder.
Enter the command `npm start` in both terminals to start the app.

You can see the deployed web app here: [RoyaleProfile](https://royaleprofile.azurewebsites.net)
It may take a while to load as it is hosted using a free tier on Azure.
